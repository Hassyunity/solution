## Ruby Tutorial - Everything is an Object
# Everything is an object in Ruby. For instance, if you type print self
# In the code-editor, Ruby treats self as the object in which it is currently referred to.

print self
Expected Output
main

# everything in object.main is an object (of object class)
# main is a method of the object class




## Ruby Tutorial - Object Methods
def odd_or_even(number)
    # add your code here
    return number.even?
end

(0...gets.to_i).each do |i|
    puts odd_or_even(gets.to_i)
end




## Ruby Tutorial - Object Method Parameters
# Three variables a, b, and c are already defined. 
# Your task is to write code that checks whether a is within the range of b and c by calling the method range?

# write your code here
a.range? b, c
